description: Use when adding or changing any API call in `web/` — a new method on the `EcoTrackApi` contract, a new fetch in `src/api/live/`, a mock in `src/mocks/`, or a TanStack Query key/mutation in a feature's `queries.ts`. Also use when a backend entity's JSON shape changed and the web app needs to follow, or when a screen needs data it cannot currently get. Covers keeping the live and mock implementations substitutable, `normalize.ts`, and query-key invalidation.

# Adding a call to the web data layer

The web app has **two interchangeable implementations behind one contract**, and
that substitutability is the property everything else rests on: mock is the
default for local development and needs no backend at all, while production
builds live. A change that lands in one implementation and not the other breaks
that quietly — usually discovered in a demo.

## The four files, in order

### 1. `src/api/contract.ts` — the contract

Add the method to the right resource group on `EcoTrackApi`, plus any input
type. Document the endpoint path relative to `/api` in a doc comment, as the
neighbours do.

**Read the request shape off the Spring controller, do not infer it.** Several
are non-obvious and the file calls them out:

- `reorderTasks` sends a **bare JSON array** of ids, not a wrapper object
- `orderHasTask` returns an **object**, not a boolean
- task photo upload uses the multipart field name **`files`**

### 2. `src/api/live/` — the real implementation

One module per resource (`tasks.ts`, `orders.ts`, …), re-exported from
`live/index.ts`. Go through the shared `http.ts` — never bare `fetch`, or you
lose the bearer token and the refresh-on-401 retry.

**If the wire shape does not match `@/types/domain`, normalise in
`src/api/live/normalize.ts`** — never in the feature layer. That module exists
because the Spring entities do not serialise cleanly:

- `Task` — `route`, `order`, `photos`, `recurringPlan` are `@JsonIgnore`d; the
  wire carries only `routeId` / `orderId` / `recurringPlanId`
- `Route` — `employee` is `@JsonIgnore`d; wire carries `employeeId` + `employeeName`
- `Order` — `date` is a `java.util.Date`
- `Employee` — roles are **objects** on `/api/employees` but **strings** on
  `/api/admin/employees`

**If you changed an entity's JSON shape in the backend, `normalize.ts` is where
the web app breaks.** Check it before assuming the change is backend-only.

### 3. `src/mocks/` — the same behaviour, in memory

Implement the same method against the seeded store in `store.ts`. Not a stub:
`mocks/__tests__/contract.test.ts` asserts the mock behaves like a *service* —
a write is visible to the next read, deletes cascade the way the backend
cascades, and the error cases the UI handles actually throw (`MockApiError`).

TypeScript proves the shapes match; that test file is what proves the behaviour
does. A contract method with no mock counterpart is a **compile error inside
that test**, by design.

### 4. The feature's `queries.ts`

`src/features/{auth,sales,technical}/queries.ts`. Keys and the mutations that
invalidate them live together, namespaced by module so invalidating a parent key
cascades:

```ts
export const keys = {
  root: ['technical'] as const,
  routes: () => ['technical', 'routes'] as const,
  routeTasks: (routeId: number) => ['technical', 'routes', routeId, 'tasks'] as const,
};
```

A new key **must** start with its module name and nest under the parent whose
invalidation should also refresh it. Expose mutations as hooks that already
invalidate what they dirty — **screens supply only toasts**, never
`invalidateQueries` of their own.

## The import rule

Feature code imports **only**:

```ts
import { api } from '@/api';
```

Never from `@/api/live` or `@/mocks` directly. That single rule is the only
thing keeping the two implementations substitutable — `src/api/index.ts` picks
one from `VITE_DATA_MODE` at build time, and a direct import silently pins a
screen to one mode.

## Verify

```bash
cd web && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test:run && npm run build
```

Then exercise it in mock mode (`npm run dev`, the default) — if the feature only
works against a live backend, the mock half is unfinished.
