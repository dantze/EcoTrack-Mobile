"""Documentation that makes checkable claims must still be true.

CLAUDE.md is the reference for how this repo works, and the skills in
.claude/skills are instructions an agent follows literally. Both go stale
silently: nothing compiles them, and a wrong pointer is worse than no pointer
because it is followed confidently.

This has already bitten twice, which is why the script exists:

  - CLAUDE.md documented `ecotrack.security.enforce` as defaulting to `false`
    long after it was changed to `true`, in the section that calls itself "the
    single most important thing to understand before touching auth".
  - a javadoc pointed at the web file that used to hold a mirrored rule, after
    that rule moved elsewhere — stale within the same afternoon it was written.
    Note this passed a path check: the file still existed, the FUNCTION had
    moved. That is why check 4 pins symbols, not just paths.

Two checks:
  1. every repo path named in the docs, and in source comments, resolves
  2. pinned numeric/string claims match the property files they describe

TODO.md is deliberately NOT path-checked: it is a historical log that refers to
deleted files on purpose ("`DriversPage.tsx` is gone").

Dependency-free — runs from repo-hygiene.yml before any toolchain is installed.
