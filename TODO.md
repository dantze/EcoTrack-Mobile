# TODO — EcoTrack

Backlog of ideas, captured from conversation. **Nothing here is implemented yet**
unless its status says otherwise.

## How to use this file

- **Never delete or cross out an item.** Mark it `[DONE]` and leave the text intact.
- Items keep their ID forever, so they can be referenced in conversation
  ("do TODO-07").
- New ideas get appended with the next free ID.

**Status legend:** `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[DONE]` done ·
`[POSTPONED]` deliberately deferred · `[?]` needs a decision first

## Open questions (answer before building the related items)

- **OQ-1 — What exactly is the difference between an Order (Comandă) and a
  Task (Sarcină)?** Related to TODO-12 and TODO-08. If this distinction is not
  obvious inside the app today, that is itself the bug, and it needs a
  conversation and probably a naming/UX fix before the calendar is built.
  *Current code:* an `Order` is what a client buys; `Task`s are generated from
  orders (and from recurring plans) and are what a driver executes on a route.
- **OQ-2 — Browser access.** Grant access to view the running web app (Chrome
  integration) so the drag-and-drop bug in TODO-07 can actually be seen rather
  than reasoned about blind.

## A. Access & admin (already designed, partly built)

### TODO-01 `[~]` Admin section in the web sidebar
New `Admin` group in the left sidebar, visible to `ADMIN` only, containing:
- **Cereri de acces** — pending enrollment requests: full name, 6-digit
  verification code, device, countdown, role picker, approve / reject.
- **Angajați** — everyone using the app, their roles, promote/demote
  (including to admin), revoke a device/session.

Also replaces the old login screen with the enrollment flow (request button →
6-digit code → waiting → *"Sunteți înregistrat cu rol de <Rol>"*).

*State:* backend is **done and tested** (222 tests green) — `AccessRequest`,
`EnrollmentService`, `/api/enrollment/**`, `/api/admin/enrollment/**`,
first-user-becomes-admin, setup code. Web and mobile screens are **not built**.
Web currently auto-signs-in as a seeded ADMIN in mock mode only.

### TODO-02 `[ ]` Fold Șoferi into Angajați
`Șoferi` should not be its own sidebar entry under Tehnic. It becomes part of
the **Angajați** overview under Admin, visible to admins only.
*Note:* the current `/soferi` page is a driver roster built around route
assignment and daily workload — decide what of that survives the merge.

## B. Rute (routes)

### TODO-03 `[ ]` Routes are weekly, not dated
A route belongs to a **day of the week**, not a calendar date. Drop the date
entirely. Changing a route changes it for every week from then on — routes are
not edited in advance for a specific date.

### TODO-04 `[ ]` Rework the Rute screen layout
- Not slidable left-to-right. One pane that scrolls **up and down**, that's it.
- Remove the date filter UI: **Data**, **Toate Datele**, **Azi** all go.
- Always display **all routes for a week** in the left pane.
- Remove the **number of Sarcini** — progress already contains that information.
  Leave only progress.
- **Șterge** becomes an icon, not a text button.
- Remove the **Șofer** column/field as it exists now. Instead: tapping the
  driver's name should let you choose/assign that driver to the route.

### TODO-05 `[ ]` Change the driver on a route
Exists in the mobile app; needs an equivalent (probably directly on the Rute
screen). Use case: a driver is off sick and someone covers for them.
Two operations:
1. Swap the driver assigned to a whole route.
2. Move some tasks from one route to another driver's route.
*Note:* user recalls ~90% of the mobile feature — check
`mobile/app/Technical/ChangeDriver.tsx` for the real behaviour before designing.

### TODO-06 `[ ]` Remove the "Asignează" button on unassigned tasks
Tasks in **Neasignate** currently have an *Asignează* button. Remove it — it
gives no control over *which* route or *which* position the task lands in.

### TODO-07 `[ ]` BUG: drag-and-drop from "Neasignate" assigns on a nudge
Picking up an order from *Neasignate* and moving it even slightly assigns it to
a route — apparently to the first valid drop slot — even when it is put back
where it started. Needs a proper fix, including the drag animation.
*Blocked on:* OQ-2 (browser access) to observe it directly.

---

## C. Sarcini (tasks)

### TODO-08 `[ ]` Task status is driver-owned
Statuses are **Nou**, **În curs**, **Finalizat**.
- Only the **driver** changes them: they mark *În curs* when they start, and
  finishing the photo upload effectively completes the task.
- For web users this is a **read-only status feed** — they observe progress,
  they do not set it.
*Related:* backend already restricts `PATCH /api/tasks/*/status` to the
assigned driver (TaskAccessPolicy).

### TODO-09 `[ ]` Better date filters on Sarcini
Today there is a quick filter for **Azi**. Add:
- A custom **interval** (from → to).
- **Săptămâna Asta** (current week).
- **Săptămâna Urmatoare** (next week).

---

## D. Comenzi (orders)

### TODO-10 `[ ]` Map picker when choosing a location on an order
Choosing the location while creating an order should work like the mobile app:
type an address, use search, **and then drag the pin** to get exact
coordinates.
*Note:* mobile does this in `LocationPicker`; that one deliberately does NOT go
through `apiFetch` (it would leak the bearer token to Google).

### TODO-11 `[ ]` Remove Activ/Inactiv from Abonamente
Drop the active/inactive concept and its UI for subscriptions. It is
effectively the client's product catalogue — there is no sensible reason for
entries to be inactive.

### TODO-12 `[ ]` Calendar view next to Comenzi
A big calendar laid out like an advent calendar ("Christmas sweets" style):
- Each day cell shows a summary of that day's information underneath the date.
- Clicking a day opens all orders for that day.
*Blocked on:* OQ-1 — needs the order/task distinction settled first.

## E. ID scanning & photo privacy

### TODO-13 `[ ]` Scan an ID to autofill nume complet + CNP
Upload a photo of an identity document and extract **full name** and **CNP**
automatically, filling the form.

### TODO-14 `[ ]` ID photos must not be readable by the developer
The stored ID photo must not be viewable by the developer/operator (i.e. by
whoever holds the DigitalOcean Spaces credentials).
*Open problem:* plain Spaces access means the bucket owner can read every
object. Needs a real design — likely client-side or app-layer encryption where
the key is not held alongside the data, plus a retention/deletion policy.
Treat this as a **prerequisite** for TODO-13 going anywhere near production:
CNP + ID photo is sensitive personal data (GDPR).

---

## F. AI

### TODO-15 `[ ]` Delete the Mistral-based AI work
Remove what was built with Mistral (intake/extraction: `IntakeConfig`,
`service/intake/**`, `IntakeMessage`, `OrderDraft`, the
`ecotrack.intake.mistral.*` config).
*Intent:* AI in this app should eventually only **autofill** things — how
exactly is undecided.

### TODO-16 `[ ]` Remove recommended additions to routes
The "recommended additions" suggestions on routes are not wanted. Remove them.

### TODO-17 `[POSTPONED]` All other AI ideas
Deliberately deferred. Do not build AI features until the autofill use case is
decided. TODO-13 (ID scanning) is the one adjacent idea that may or may not end
up AI-backed.

## Appendix — current state (context)

- **Backend:** enrollment/device-approval auth is complete and tested; passwords
  and Google sign-in are fully removed; `enforce` defaults to `true`; refresh
  tokens last 365 days and rotate on use. Full suite: 222 tests, 0 failing.
- **Web:** untouched apart from mock-mode auto-login as ADMIN. Still shows the
  old password/Google login screen in live builds.
- **Mobile:** untouched — still password login, no enrollment screens.
- **Deploy:** `deploy.yml` (backend + web to VPS, one domain via Caddy) and
  `deploy-mobile.yml` (EAS OTA + builds). See `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- **No users and no server exist yet**, so nothing here needs a migration path.
