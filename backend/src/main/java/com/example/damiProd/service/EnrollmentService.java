/**
 * Device enrollment: the only way anyone gets into this system.
 *
 * There is no password and no self-registration. A device asks, an admin
 * approves it and picks a role, and the device exchanges a one-time secret for
 * session tokens. See {@link AccessRequest} for what each field protects.
 *
 * FIRST RUN. With an empty employees table nobody can approve anything, so the
 * first request is auto-approved as ADMIN - that is the "first user to open the
 * app is the admin" rule. Left bare that is a land-grab: whoever reaches a
 * freshly deployed server first owns it, permanently, with no password path to
 * take it back. So unless {@code ecotrack.enrollment.require-setup-code} is
 * turned off, that first request must also carry a one-time code printed to the
 * server log at startup. It is not a password: single-use, never stored, gone
 * the moment an admin exists.
 *
 * ADMIN LOCKOUT. The same "nobody can approve anything" state is reachable a
 * second way, and by accident (TODO-30): the last ADMIN presses Deconectare, or
 * their only device is lost, and every ADMIN session is gone while the ADMIN
 * <em>employee</em> still exists. The first-run path does not reopen, because it
 * keys on an EMPTY employees table - so the only cure was destroying the
 * database. {@link #isAdminLockedOut()} detects it (zero usable ADMIN sessions,
 * measured on the refresh token) and a recovery code is logged, exactly like the
 * first-run code; presenting it on /request mints a fresh ADMIN.
 *
 * <strong>Recovery ALWAYS requires the code, even when
 * {@code require-setup-code} is false.</strong> That flag exempts the first-run
 * land-grab, which needs someone to reach a brand-new server before its owner.
 * Lockout is far more reachable than that - one button on one phone - so an
 * unauthenticated caller must never be able to walk into it. The whole mechanism
 * is switched off with {@code ecotrack.enrollment.allow-admin-recovery=false},
 * which restores the old behaviour: lockout is permanent.
